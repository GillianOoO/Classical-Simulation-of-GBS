# Classical-Simulation-of-GBS
Classical sampling algorithm for Gaussian Boson Sampling.

There are two main procedure, one is GBSExpSpace.cpp (which is used to sample with Exponential space), one is GBSPolySpace.cpp (which is used to sample with Polynomial space).

Before performing our procedure, firstly you need to install some package to run the Hafnian procedure, such as LAPACK and OPENBLAS. You can also look up for some details in https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus.

The code for computing Hafnian is also from https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus.
